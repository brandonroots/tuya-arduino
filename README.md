# Tuya-Arduino
Inspired by the work of folks on [Tuya-Convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert), this guide takes a more direct approach to hardware hacking and flashing Tuya IoT modules. 

# Tuya

A Chinese company named Tuya offers a free-to-brand turnkey smart home solution to anyone. Using their offer is simple, since everything can be done by clicking through the [Tuya web page](https://en.tuya.com/), from choosing your pre-designed products or pre-programmed wifi-modules (mostly ESP8266) to build your own app. In the end, this has resulted in over 11,000 devices 'made' by over 10,000 vendors using Tuya's firmware and cloud services.

While [Tuya-Convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert) takes an entirely software oriented approach to reflashing firmware on Tuya modules the company has made this increasingly more difficult through firmware updates. In response this guide provides steps involved in hardware flashing a Tuya module through the Arduino IDE after some simple hardware modifications, which should work regardless of Tuya firmware version.

# Why

I wanted access to granular data about my energy use and an option to export that data from a smart plug. 

Amazon is flooded with affordable smart plugs using Tuya modules and they are incredibly cheap, however at the time of this writing the rebranded Tuya apps and [Smart Life](https://ifttt.com/smartlife) IFTTT service do not provide an option to export power consumption data. End users are locked into using Tuya services and at the mercy of what appear to be fly by night companies to contiue providing updates to the apps for their rebranded Tuya devices to stay operational.

Please be sure that you understand what you're doing before using this guide and software. Flashing an alternative firmware and modifying hardware can lead to unexpected behavior and/or render the device unusable so that it might be permanently damaged.
